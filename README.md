# Saas search with `autcomplete.js`

A searchbar which can not only search for results but also perform tasks at your fingertips. Tasks such as toggling your theme to dark/light, searching the same on google, etc. It's not just a searchbar, it's a swiss army knife.

This demo is made using [autocomplete-suggestions-plugin](https://github.com/appbaseio/autocomplete-suggestions-plugin) and [autocomplete](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete).

## Use cases

New users not familiar with the interface can get lost and not find features quickly. Help them by enabling discovery of features through search.

Users hate using the mouse. Eliminate the need to use the mouse by getting more done through the keyboard. Navigate pages without even having to click on a link.

If your site has a billion features then your users might not find the correct feature when they need it. Solve the problem of feature discovery through search.
